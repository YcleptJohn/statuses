Bit of confusion between status API and devops status APIs,

one is general 'healthy' overview with little more detail

the devops API might provide more info.. found a historical RSS feed so far.. need to find ongoing info

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/rest/api/resourcehealth/availabilitystatuses/getbyresource ??
all seem to be stuck behind a subscription-id which is attached to an azure subscription.. there is a free year so might be able to do that to gain access...
does look like a valuable API
