This resulted in impaired EC2 instances and degraded EBS volume performance for resources in the affected area of the Availability Zone. The overheating was caused by a control system failure that caused multiple, redundant cooling systems to fail in parts of the affected Availability Zone. The chillers were restored at 11:21 PM PDT and temperatures in the affected areas began to return to normal. As temperatures returned to normal, power was restored to the affected instances. By 2:30 AM PDT, the vast majority of instances and volumes had recovered. We have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the loss of power. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes if possible. Some of the affected instances may require action from customers and we will be reaching out to those customers with next steps.<br><br>Additional details are available <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/56489/\">here</a>.

Due to the way that DNS queries are processed, this attack was first experienced by many other DNS server operators as the queries made their way through DNS resolvers on the internet to Route 53. The attack targeted specific DNS names and paths, notably those used to access the global names for S3 buckets.\n\nBecause this attack was widely distributed, a small number of ISPs operating affected DNS resolvers implemented mitigation strategies of their own in an attempt to control the traffic. This is causing DNS lookups through these resolvers for a small number of AWS names to fail. We are doing our best to identify and contact these operators, as quickly as possible, and working with them to enhance their mitigations so that they do not cause impact to valid requests.

A data store used by a subsystem responsible for the configuration of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks is currently offline and the engineering team are working to restore it. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. In order to do this restore, we needed to disable writes. Error rates and latencies for the networking-related APIs will continue until the restore has been completed and writes re-enabled. We are working through the recovery process now. With issues like this, it is always difficult to provide an accurate ETA, but we expect to complete the restore process within the next 2 hours and begin to allow API requests to proceed once again. We will continue to keep you updated if that ETA changes. Connectivity to existing instances is not impacted. Also, launch requests that refer to regional objects like subnets that already exist will succeed at this stage, as they do not depend on the affected subsystem. If you know the subnet ID, you can use that to launch instances within the region. We apologize for the impact and continue to work towards full resolution. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">10:10 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We continue to make steady progress towards the restoration of the affected data store and are currently within the 2 hours ETA published above.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">10:55 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We have completed the restoration of the affected data store but are still working towards re-enabling writes. We have seen an improvement in successful launches over the last 20 minutes and expect that to continue as we work towards full recovery. </div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">11:45 PM PST</span>&nbsp;We can confirm that all error rates and latencies have returned to normal levels. The issue has been resolved and the service is operating normally.</div><div><span class=\"yellowfg\">Jan 23, 12:30 AM PST</span>&nbsp;Now that we are fully recovered, we wanted to provide a brief summary of the issue. Starting at 4:07 PM PST, customers began to experience increased error rates and latencies for the network-related APIs in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region. Launches of new EC2 instances also experienced increased failure rates as a result of this issue. Connectivity to existing instances was not affected by this event. We immediately began investigating the root cause and identified that the data store used by the subsystem responsible for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) regional state was impaired. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. We began the data store restoration process, which took a few hours and by 10:50 PM PST, we had fully restored the primary node in the affected data store. At this stage, we began to see recovery in instance launches within the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region, restoring many customer applications and services to a healthy state. We continued to bring the data store back to a fully operational state and by 11:20 PM PST, all API error rates and latencies had fully recovered. Other AWS services - including AppStream, Elastic Load Balancing, ElastiCache, Relational Database Service, Amazon WorkSpaces and Lambda â€“ were also affected by this event. We apologize for any inconvenience this event may have caused as we know how critical our services are to our customers. We are never satisfied with operational performance of our services that is anything less than perfect, and will do everything we can to learn from this event and drive improvement across our services.</div>",
